# Socialize

Welcome to Socialize, a social networking application that allows users to connect with friends, share moments, and interact with posts. With a focus on user authentication and dynamic content, Socialize offers various features to enhance your social experience. This is a web application which was created while exploring React Redux and MongodDB while also practicing my CSS, javascript skills. There is not a lot of functionality yet as my main goal was to understand React Redux.

I do not own any of the media used and they were used for the sole purpose of practicing and learning.
